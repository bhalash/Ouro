        <p>The prototyping cycle is integral to bioprinting: dream it, draw it, print it and repeat. Prototyping is also a time- and money-intensive process, with prints taking upward of a day to create.</p>

        <p>With the <?php printf(PRODUCT_NAME); ?>, our goal is the is a targeted decrease in length of the cycle of conceptualization and iteration. At the same time <?php printf(COMPANY_NAME); ?> plan to reduce costs through an open bioprint ecosystem, modularization of components and collaboration.</p>
